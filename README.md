# Font End Web Development Assignment

## Mo Maudarbux Portfolio site

## Abstract

This website is an online Portfolio to showcase a sample of the works that I
have done, some drafts I have created and links to my social media, and repositories.
This website also contains an online CV, which can be viewed by potential recruiters,
to get a taste of what skills and experiences I have. There is also a contact form readily
available if they wish to contact me. This website currently has a long way to go before it
is completely ready and up to scratch. It was built using CSS3, HTML5 and JS es6, hopefully
all to standard. I hope to continue working on the site further, and hopefully put it to
good use.

## Life Cycle

### Wierframes

From the beginning, I thought abot this website with responsiveness in mind. The first wireframes
I constructed were from a Mobile perspective, to try and help shape the way that I wanted this site
to be built. Below is the first wireframe I had in mind for the site.
