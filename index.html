            <h1>About Me!</h1>

            <p>Hello and welcome to my portfolio website! My (legal) name is Muraz
              Maudarbux, but I mostly go by Mo. This site was initally created
              as part of my final year 'Front End Web Development' assignment,
              and I decided that this would be a great opportunity to create a
              great portfolio website, to showcase all my work, interests and
              creative style.</p>

            <p>I'm currently a final year student studying at Computer Science at
              De Montfort University. This website will be used as an assignment
              for one of my final year modules, but I hope to continue using this
              site in the future, and develop and change it as I Design, Develop
              and get more experience in the industry. I also hope to update the
              site as industry standards change to keep up with the world of web
              Design.</p>

            <p>The menu above will take you to the other pages of this one page
              site, that changes the content with JS. You'll be able to view my
              work as well as my CV and links to my social media such as Facebook,
              Twitter, Linked In, and even a link to my GitHub repositories! (Hint
              these can be found by clicking the logo, top right ;P ).</p>

            <p>I hope you enjoy the site, and if you have any queries (Or job offers)
              feel free to contact me through the contact form!</p>

            <p>This is a draft i created in photoshop for blog idea I came up with.
              This is only and inital rough markup, and hasn't progressed much beyond
              the intial concept.</p>

            <img src="images\rsz_gccx.png" alt="OnStar Site">
            <p>This is a draft of what ended up being a completed web app for General
              Motors, OnStar team. Whilst working for GM on my placement year, I
              was tasked with createing a web based app, as a communication platform
              for the local team. The application was completed, but all rights belong
              to GM. Becuase of certain laws, some of the image had to be covered up,
              and I sadly can't produce the original code, but this draft shows what
              the application would eventuially become.</p>

            <p>Other than HTML and CSS and some JS, as part of my Computer Science
            course, I have been exposed to many different programming languages and styles.
            Available on my GitHub are examples of my work with C, Java (functional and OO),
            SQL and PHP to name a few. Click on the image to check it out! </p>
